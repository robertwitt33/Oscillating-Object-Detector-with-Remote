# Oscillating-Object-Detector-with-Remote

In this arduino project, I first glued the Ultrasonic Sensor to the Servo Motor propeller. The Ultrasonic Sensor would constantly be sending out high frequency sound waves and wait for them to be reflected back. Based on the time it took for the waves to be reflected, I was able to calculate the distance between the sensor and the object using a simple formula. I used an “if statement” to detect when the distance is below 15 centimeters, which would cause the red light to blink and the motor to stop rotating. Finally, I used the remote control and the receiver to set up buttons that would increase/decrease the speed of the rotating motor. Each button on the remote sent out a specific signal to the receiver, and I was able to execute unique code based on which signal the receiver recorded.
